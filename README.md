# ZeroDrag
Your Formula 1 Aerodynamic Drag Calculator

Live Demo on Vercel (add the link when deployed)

## About ZeroDrag
ZeroDrag is a web-based calculator designed to help Formula 1 enthusiasts and engineers estimate the aerodynamic drag forces acting on an F1 car.  While true zero drag is impossible,  this tool lets you explore how factors like velocity,  frontal area, and drag coefficient impact performance.

## Features
Calculate drag force (in Newtons) based on user-provided inputs
Input fields for:
Velocity (km/h)
Frontal Area (m²)
Drag Coefficient
Air Density (kg/m³)
Installation
ZeroDrag is a web-based tool. There's no installation required! Head over to the live demo: [link to your Vercel deployment]

## Usage
Enter the velocity, frontal area, and drag coefficient of your hypothetical (or real-world) F1 car.
Adjust the air density if you wish to account for altitude or temperature.
Click "Calculate" to see the estimated drag force.

## Important Notes
ZeroDrag provides a simplified aerodynamic drag calculation. Real-world F1 aerodynamics are incredibly complex and depend on numerous additional factors.
Air density is affected by both altitude and temperature.
Drag coefficients of F1 cars vary significantly depending on design and wing configurations.
